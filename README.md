## Overview

### The challenge

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I learned to be patient. 

This challenge has been the most time consuming of them all, mostly becuase I couldn't figure out how to position the images properly. 

Most of the stuff here are things I've been working on, so this provided an opportunity to practice
more than anything.

However, I did learn how to implement a list that shows up when you click on one of the navigation
options, and overall, how to make a landing page. 

It's a lot more challenging than I expected and involved way more lines of code, but I'm glad I
got the reps in and look forward to working on such projects in future to get better at them.

### Continued development

I lost track of time on this one because of how it frustrated me. I've also been feeling kind of
burned out lately with migraines throughout the day, but either way, I feel good now that it's done.

It's not my best work because I feel like I used absolute positioning more than I needed, but this 
is mostly because the usual methods didn't get me where I wanted. 

I'm submitting this solution the way it is so that I can get some feedback on how to position things
better then hopefully, implement those changes later on as corrections. 

### Useful resources

Most of the knowledge required for this I had some grasp on or required a little bit of reading, but
nothing too serious, so no reason to add any links here.
